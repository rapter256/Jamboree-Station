  ## Lore

  Goblins are a genetic offshoot of humanity which are believed to have either been created to act as to act as independant settlers of far off worlds, given their tenacity
  with creating technology from trash, or as a counterpart of the Dwarves for those interested in different aspects of fantasy media.
  Goblins as well are notable as being one of the few genetic offshoots that attempted to create a species of their own.
  This species would be known as the Floor Goblin, something considered to be a rare but nonetheless irritating pest on many stations.
