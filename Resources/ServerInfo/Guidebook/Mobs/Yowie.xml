  # Yowie

  Yowie are a once-thought urban myth, turned newly discovered mystical species of bipedal hairy creature.
  Their body is larger than most other species in stature, with the downside of them [color=#AAFF00]not being able to fit into most Nanotrasen external wear or shoes[/color] (they can barely squeeze into softsuits), or [color=#AAFF00] being able to be carried by others[/color].
  Their fur also allows them to take [color=#baf2ef]less cold damage[/color].

  Their stature makes their unarmed punch deal [color=#ec3a3a]2x the damage[/color] of a human punch.
  They are naturally able to wideswing their unarmed punches. This means that they cannot shove, and thus cannot use martial arts that require shoving.

  They are larger, making them easier to hit in combat, but they take 25% less Blunt, Slash and Piercing damage.
  They also weigh more, allowing them to pull lighter species with ease.

  They have a natural resistance to most chemicals, with the metabolizing these chemicals being done in their liver.

## Lore

  The Yowie, as a species, appear to have developed alongside humanity, with many sightings of them having been documented throughout human history. Once formally rediscovered
  in 3XXX, it was found that the Yowie both had an influence on the culture of Australia around the timeframe of the 21st century, but as well as a hand in the development
  of certain narcotics originating from Earth. These contributions, alongside many human's desires to leave Earth, led to the Yowie both being given ownership of
  the country of Australia but as well as the means to expand into space as they wish.
