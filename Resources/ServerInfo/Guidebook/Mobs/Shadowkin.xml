  ## Lore

  Once hidden away in the darkest crevices of their origin world, Mars, the Shadowkin are a very reserved species.
  As such, much of their culture is a mystery to the majority of the galaxy. What is known is that many take on names after an object, role, or sound sequence that is significant to them.
