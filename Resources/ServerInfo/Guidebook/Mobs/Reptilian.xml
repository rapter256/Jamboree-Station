  ## Lore

  Hailing from the planet Moghes, the Reptillian species, also known as the Unath, were the first which human's encountered in their transition to the stars. An important part of many of
  their cultures seems to be the process of hunting and gathering, which in recent is often expressed via frequent hunting trips to far off worlds.
